temporal_logic
==============

A regular language implementation of Siskind's event logic. Described here: http://sjf.io/Regular_Languages_For_Siskinds_Event_Logic.pdf

Designed as a proof that the temporal logic used in event recognition can be implemented as regular language/finite automata. 

Includes a regular expression engine and a complete set of functions for constructing and combining finite automata.
